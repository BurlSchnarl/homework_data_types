		* Exercise Four
		* Here is a very simple graphing program which performs on a transform on a point.
		* What are the *types* of x, y, z, a, and b?
        
        x is a number
        y is a float
        z is an array
        a is...not sure
        b is...not sure

		var z = [x, y];

		z[0] = z[0] + 2;
		z[1] = z[1] + 2;

		var a = "x is " + z[0];

		var b = "y is " + z[1];
